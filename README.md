CryptSharp

Install using NUGET - https://nuget.org/packages/CryptSharp/
==========

------------------

CryptSharp provides Blowfish, BCrypt, SCrypt, and PBKDF2 for any HMAC (.Net's built-in PBKDF2 implementation only supports SHA-1). 
If you are looking to store passwords in a database, BCrypt is much harder for an attacker to break than, say, simple MD5 or SHA-1.

You can get a vivid example of the differences in time-to-crack here: https://passfault.appspot.com/

Using CryptSharp is simple. To crypt a password, add the assembly to your references and type:

<pre><code>
using CryptSharp;
string crypted = Crypter.Blowfish.Crypt(keyBytes); //or
string crypted = Crypter.Blowfish.Crypt(keyBytes, Crypter.Blowfish.GenerateSalt(6));
</code></pre>

To test the crypted password against a potential password, use:

<pre><code>
using CryptSharp;
bool matches = Crypter.SafeEquals(crypted, Crypter.Blowfish.Crypt(testKeyBytes, crypted));
</code></pre>

Be aware when using BCrypt that only the first 72 bytes of a password are used. This limitation is not specific to this implementation. If you are likely to pass byte arrays over 72 bytes in length, call PadKeyThenCrypt to have the extra bytes removed.

.Net Membership Provider
==========

If your looking for a way to shore up your .net Membership Provider without having to create your own implementation.
Take a look at https://github.com/skradel/Zetetic.Security ; it will greatly simplify the addition of
bcrypt to your SqlMembershipProvider (standard setup).
